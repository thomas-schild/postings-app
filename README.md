# postings-app
A simple app allowing to post and read postings.
Main target is not on functionality but it is used as a training on the MEAN-stack, i.e. MongoDB, Express, Angular.js and Node.js.

Building the app follows the track paved by Jeff Dickey's Book ['Write Modern Web Apps with the MEAN Stack'](http://www.amazon.com/Write-Modern-Apps-MEAN-Stack/dp/0133930157).
See also the according [github repository](https://github.com/dickeyxxx/mean-sample).

The code also incorporates John Papa's suggestions ragarding [Angular.js style](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).

## Setup
First of all You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

Further on You will need to [install MongoDB] (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/).

As this is node.js based stuff, You need to load the npm modules first:
`npm install`
